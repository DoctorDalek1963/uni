% {{{ Q3
\question{3}

\begin{questionbody}
Suppose that $(a_n)$ is an increasing sequence. Assume that $(a_n)$ has a subsequence $(a_{n_j})$ that converges to some $l \in \R$ as $j \to \infty$. Show that $a_n \to l$ as $n \to \infty$.
\end{questionbody}

Since $\l(a_{n_j}\r) \to \ell$, that means $\exists \varepsilon > 0, N \in \mathbb N$ such that $|a_{n_j} - \ell| < \varepsilon\ \forall\ n_j \ge N$.

Since $n_{j+1} > n_j\ \forall\ j \in \mathbb N$ and $\ell - \varepsilon < a_{n_j} < \ell + \varepsilon\ \forall\ n_j \ge N$, $(a_n)$ is bounded above by $\ell + \varepsilon$.

Therefore $|a_n - \ell| < \varepsilon\ \forall\ n \ge N$.

% {{{ Q10
\newquestion{10}

\begin{questionbody}
Use the comparison test to investigate the convergence of $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ in the following cases.

Before you apply the comparison test rigorously, you should use \enquote{heuristics} to work out the answer you expect, so that you know whether to try to bound the terms in the sum above or below.

You can assume that $\sum \f1{n^p}$ diverges if $0 < p \le 1$ and converges for $p > 1$.
\end{questionbody}

I had absolutely no idea what to do with this one, sorry.

\subsection{~} % 10.a

\begin{questionbody}
\[ a_n = \df{\sqrt{n + 1}}{\sqrt{n^3 + 2}} \]
\end{questionbody}

For large $n$, $a_n \approx \dfrac{\sqrt n}{\sqrt{n^3}} = \dfrac{1}{n^2}$, so we expect $\sum a_n < \infty$.

\subsection{~} % 10.b

\begin{questionbody}
\[ a_n = \df{n - 3}{n^3 + 2} \]
\end{questionbody}

For large $n$, $a_n \approx \dfrac{1}{n^2}$, so we expect $\sum a_n < \infty$.

% {{{ Q15
\newquestion{15}

\begin{questionbody}
Use the integral test to find for which $\alpha > 0$ the sum \[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \f 1{n {(\log n)}^\alpha}
\] converges and for which $\alpha > 0$ it diverges.
\end{questionbody}

\[
\intlim 1n {\f1{x {(\log x)}^\alpha}} x = {\l[ \f{{(\log x)}^{1 - \alpha}}{1 - \alpha} \r]}_1^n = \f{{(\log n)}^{1 - \alpha}}{1 - \alpha} \qquad \text{where } \alpha \ne 1
\]

Since ${(\log n)}^\beta \to \infty$ exactly when $b > 0$, we know that the integral is bounded when $1 - \alpha > 0 \implies \alpha > 1$. And the integral is unbounded when $\alpha < 1$ and undefined when $\alpha = 1$.

Therefore $\ds\sum_{n=2}^\infty \f1{n {(\log n)}^\alpha}$ converges when $\alpha > 1$ and diverges when $\alpha \le 1$.

% {{{ Q16
\newquestion{16}

\begin{questionbody}
Why do the following series converge? Do they converge absolutely?
\end{questionbody}

\subsection{~} % 16.a

\begin{questionbody}
\[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty {(-1)}^{n+1} \f1{2n+1} \]
\end{questionbody}

The absolute version of this sum is the sum of reciprocals of odd numbers. Much like the Harmonic series, this series diverges to $\infty$, so the series does not converge absolutely.

It does however converge conditionally to $1 - \dfrac\pi4$ thanks to the alternating minus signs.

\subsection{~} % 16.b

\begin{questionbody}
\[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty {(-1)}^{n+1} \f1{n^2} \]
What is the value of this sum?
\end{questionbody}

The absolute version of this sum is \[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \l\vert {(-1)}^{n+1} \f1{n^2} \r\vert = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \f1{n^2}
\]

This is the Basel problem, which famously equals $\df{\pi^2}6$. Therefore this series is absolutely convergent, and therefore convergent.
