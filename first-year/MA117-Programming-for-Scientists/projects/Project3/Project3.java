 * This file contains a template for the class Project3. None of methods are
 * implemented and they do not have placeholder return statements. Make sure
 * you have carefully read the project formulation before starting to work
 * on this file. You will also need to have completed the Matrix class, as
 * well as GeneralMatrix and TriMatrix.
 *
 * Remember not to change the names, parameters or return types of any
 * variables in this file!
 *
 * The function of the methods and instance variables are outlined in the
 * comments directly above them.
 *
 * Tasks:
 *
 * 1) Complete this class with the indicated methods and instance variables.
 *
 * 2) Fill in the following fields:
