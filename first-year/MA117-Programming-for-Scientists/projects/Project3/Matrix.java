/*
 * PROJECT III: Matrix.java
 *
 * This file contains a template for the class Matrix. Not all methods are
 * implemented and they do not have placeholder return statements. Make sure
 * you have carefully read the project formulation before starting to work
 * on this file.
 *
 * Some of the methods here are abstract. That means that they must be
 * implemented by their subclasses. If you're not sure about abstract classes,
 * you should consult the lecture notes for more information.
 *
 * Remember not to change the names, parameters or return types of any
 * variables in this file!
 *
 * The function of the methods and instance variables are outlined in the
 * comments directly above them.
 *
 * Tasks:
 *
 * 1) Complete this class with the indicated methods and instance variables.
 *
 * 2) Fill in the following fields:
